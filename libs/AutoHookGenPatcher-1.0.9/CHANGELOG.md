### Changed

**Initial release — Differences to the original HookGenPatcher**

- Instead of only having a fixed list of files to generate MMHOOK files for, AutoHookGenPatcher will get the MMHOOK file references from installed plugins, and generates those MMHOOK files if possible.
- AutoHookGenPatcher makes use of a cache file to quickly check if everything is still up to date, without needing to check every MMHOOK file for that information.
- Hook Generation is now multithreaded, meaning that generating multiple MMHOOK files takes less time. For example, generating an MMHOOK file for every file in the `Managed` directory of Lethal Company takes about **22.5 seconds** instead of **40.0 seconds** it would take with no multithreading, on my machine.
